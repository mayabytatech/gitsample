      SPRING BOOT 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Benefits: 
-no need of xml configurations.
-support come with MAVEN 3.2+


POM:
-maven plugin:  create an executable jar.

Spring:
-create a production ready application.favours coc- convention over configuration.
- coc: -coding by convention.
       -eliminate the use of unnecessary configuration files when we doesnt follow the convention.(eg: properties file name application.properties if we
are using other names it has to be configured seperate)


IOC/DI:
-You want to write classes that depend on classes whose concrete implementations are not known at compile time
-specify the dependency,object is set through constructor or setters and the container then inject the dependency to the bean.
-bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies by using direct construction of classes, or a
mechanism such as the Service Locator pattern.


-BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality,
-ApplicationContext adds more enterprise-specific functionality.

BEAN:
A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed
by a Spring IoC container.


container:The container will create the objects, wire them together, configure them, and manage their complete life cycle from creation till destruction.

Core container:
-spring-core//
-spring-beans//ioc and dependancy injection provide
-spring-context// solid base from core and bean
-springcontext-support//third party library integration with spring application.
-spring-expression//query and manipulating object graph at run time.

Spring Framework consists of 20 modules.


"bill of materials" (BOM) dependency.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
You can import the spring-framework-bom in your dependencyManagement section to ensure
that all spring dependencies (both direct and transitive) are at the same version.
<dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-framework-bom</artifactId>
<version>5.0.0.M1</version>
<type>pom</type>
<scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>


Distributed ziip file
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-maven/gradle is dependency management tool  

-Distribution zips are published to the Spring Maven Repository (this is just for our convenience, you
donâ€™t need Maven or any other build system in order to download them).

-The mandatory logging dependency in Spring is the Jakarta Commons Logging API (JCL).


LOGGING
>>>>>>>>>
-spring defualty provide the jakarta coommons logging (JCL)   demerit: the binding or the implementation class available at the run time.
                                                                        so we opt SLF4J(simple logging faccade for java) having compile time logging
RELATIVE CLASSPATH AND ABSOlUTE
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
home
 |
 --- user
   |
   --- mydir
     |
     --- myfile.txt   
																		
 for relative path, you just need to do 'cd mydir'. If you want to use absolute path, you need to do 'cd /home/user/mydir'.
